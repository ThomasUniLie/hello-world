# hello-world
This is test project. Let's see what happens here at GitHub.

I am doing this project as I am playing around with some GitHub data. I have something in mind and I am excited to see if it works.
I am aiming to connect various mining techniques in order to understand the logics behind work in online communities.

Let's add some more thoughts to this.

In order for this project to work, I need to integrate a few things.

First, it is important that I understand how the platform works.
Second, I should have a feeling for how users move through the functionalities. 
Third, research and practice should be linked such that there is a contribution in the end.
